# How a Helix = Sine & Cosine Waves and the Unit Circle
## MATLAB animation

Animation of a helix being drawn with projections onto perpendicular planes. Dynamic camera views to make things visually interesting.

Runs on MATLAB 2014b+ (although could be adapted for earlier if there's great interest).

If you find this interesting, feel free to let me know!
